  "03-Protocol-Overview": {
    "slug": "03-Protocol-Overview",
    "content": "# 3. Protocol Overview\n\nThere are technically three distinct (sub)protocols needed in order to fully use all of the features proposed in this document:\n\n1. **Mining Protocol**  \n   The main protocol used for mining and the direct successor of Stratum v1.\n   A mining device uses it to communicate with its upstream node, pool, or a proxy.\n   A proxy uses it to communicate with a pool (or another proxy).\n   This protocol needs to be implemented in all scenarios.\n   For cases in which a miner or pool does not support transaction selection, this is the only protocol used.\n\n2. **Job Declaration Protocol**  \n   Used by a miner (a whole mining farm) to declare a block template with a pool.\n   Results of this declaration can be re-used for all mining connections to the pool to reduce computational intensity.\n   In other words, a single declaration can be used by an entire mining farm or even multiple farms with hundreds of thousands of devices, making it far more efficient.\n   This is separate to allow pools to terminate such connections on separate infrastructure from mining protocol connections (i.e. share submissions).\n   Further, such connections have very different concerns from share submissions - work declaration likely requires, at a minimum, some spot-checking of work validity, as well as potentially substantial rate-limiting (without the inherent rate-limiting of share difficulty).\n\n3. **Template Distribution Protocol**  \n   A similarly-framed protocol for getting information about the next block out of Bitcoin Core.\n   Designed to replace `getblocktemplate` with something much more efficient and easy to implement for those implementing other parts of Stratum v2.\n\nMeanwhile, there are five possible roles (types of software/hardware) for communicating with these protocols.\n\n1. **Mining Device**  \n   The actual device computing the hashes. This can be further divided into header-only mining devices and standard mining devices, though most devices will likely support both modes.\n\n2. **Pool Service**  \n   Produces jobs (for those not declaring jobs via the Job Declaration Protocol), validates shares, and ensures blocks found by clients are propagated through the network (though clients which have full block templates MUST also propagate blocks into the Bitcoin P2P network).\n\n3. **Mining Proxy (optional)**  \n   Sits in between Mining Device(s) and Pool Service, aggregating connections for efficiency.\n   May optionally provide additional monitoring, receive work from a Job Declarator and use custom work with a pool, or provide other services for a farm.\n\n4. **Job Declarator (optional)**  \n   It is further divided into a Job Declarator Client and a Job Declarator Server.\n   The Job Declarator Client receives custom block templates from a Template Provider and declares use of them with the Job Declarator Server (which is typically Pool side) using the Job Declaration Protocol.\n\n5. **Template Provider**  \n   Generates custom block templates to be passed to the Job Declarator for eventual mining.\n   This is usually just a Bitcoin Core full node (or possibly some other node implementation).\n\nThe Mining Protocol is used for communication between a Mining Device and Pool Service, Mining Device and Mining Proxy, Mining Proxy and Mining Proxy, or Mining Proxy and Pool Service.\n\nThe Job Declaration Protocol is used for communication between a Job Declarator Client and a Job Declarator Server (which is typically Pool side).\n\nThe Template Distribution Protocol is used for communication either between a Job Declarator Client and a Template Provider or between a Pool Service and Template Provider.\n\n\nOne type of software/hardware can fulfill more than one role (e.g. a Mining Proxy is often both a Mining Proxy and a Job Declarator and may occasionally further contain a Template Provider in the form of a full node on the same device).\n\nEach sub-protocol is based on the same technical principles and requires a connection oriented transport layer, such as TCP.\nIn specific use cases, it may make sense to operate the protocol over a connectionless transport with FEC or local broadcast with retransmission.\nHowever, that is outside of the scope of this document.\nThe minimum requirement of the transport layer is to guarantee ordered delivery of the protocol messages.\n\n## 3.1 Data Types Mapping\n\nMessage definitions use common data types described here for convenience.\nMultibyte data types are always serialized as little-endian.\n\n\n| Data Type | Byte Length                                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| BOOL          | 1                                                                                            | Boolean value.

This extension must be included in any protocol implementation that plans to support additional protocol extensions.\n\nExtensions MUST require negotiation with the recipient of the message to check that the extension is supported before sending non-version-negotiation messages for it.\nThis prevents the needlessly wasted bandwidth and potentially serious performance degradation of extension messages when the recipient does not support them.\n\nSee `ChannelEndpointChanged` message in Common Protocol Messages for details about how extensions interact with dynamic channel reconfiguration in proxies.\n\n## 3.4.1 Stratum V2 TLV Encoding Model\n\nTo ensure a consistent and extensible way of adding optional fields to existing messages, **Stratum V2 supports Type-Length-Value (TLV) encoding** for protocol extensions. This model allows for structured, backward-compatible extensions while ensuring that unknown fields can be safely ignored.\n\n### TLV Structure\n\nEach TLV-encoded field follows this format:\n\n| **Field**  | **Size** | **Description** |\n|------------|---------|----------------|\n| **Type**   | 3 bytes (U16 + U8) | Identifies the TLV field. The first 2 bytes represent the `extension_type`, and the third byte represents the `field_type` within the extension context. |\n| **Length** | 2 bytes (U16) | Indicates the size (in bytes) of the Value field. |\n| **Value**  | `N` bytes  | The actual data of the extension field, of variable length. |\n\n- The **Type** field consists of **3 bytes**, where:\n   - The **first 2 bytes** (`U16`) correspond to the negotiated `extension_type`, ensuring modular and self-contained extensions.\n   - The **third byte** (`U8`) specifies the `field_type` defined in the extension, allowing multiple fields to be added within the same message.\n- The **Length** field defines the exact size of the **Value**, allowing efficient message parsing.\n- If the **Length** is `0x0000`, the **Value** field is omitted.\n- When multiple fields extend the same message type, their order **MUST** match the order defined in the extension.\n\n### Usage Guidelines\n\n- **TLV fields MUST be placed at the end of the message payload.** This ensures compatibility with existing Stratum V2 messages.\n- **TLV fields MUST be ordered by `extension_type`.** Since all extensions are negotiated beforehand, the recipient MUST process TLV fields in order of `extension_type` and use their `Type` identifiers to correctly interpret them.\n- **Order of TLV fields within the same extension MUST be respected.** If an extension defines multiple TLV fields to extend a single message, they **MUST** appear in the exact order specified by the extension’s documentation.\n- **Length constraints MUST be respected.** Each extension must specify the valid length range for its TLV fields. If a TLV field exceeds the maximum length allowed by its specification, the recipient MUST reject the message.\n\n### Example: Extending `SubmitSharesExtended`\n\nIf extension **0x0002** (Worker-Specific Hashrate Tracking) is negotiated, clients must append the following TLV field to `SubmitSharesExtended`:\n```\n[TYPE: 0x0002 0x01] [LENGTH: 0x000A] [VALUE: \"Worker_001\"]\n```\nEncoded as:\n```\n00 02 01 00 0A 57 6F 72 6B 65 72 5F 30 30 31\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `00 02 01` → TLV Type (Extension `0x0002`, Field `0x01` — `user_identity`)\n- `00 0A` → Length = 10 bytes\n- `57 6F 72 6B 65 72 5F 30 30 31` → `\"Worker_001\"` (UTF-8 encoded)\n\nA device processing `SubmitSharesExtended` **MUST scan for TLV fields** matching any negotiated extensions, allowing for future extensibility without breaking compatibility.\n\n\n## 3.5 Error Codes\n\nThe protocol uses string error codes.\nThe list of error codes can differ between implementations, and thus implementations MUST NOT take any automated action(s) on the basis of an error code.\nImplementations/pools SHOULD provide documentation on the meaning of error codes and error codes SHOULD use printable ASCII where possible.\nFurthermore, error codes MUST NOT include control characters.\n\nTo make interoperability simpler, the following error codes are provided which implementations SHOULD consider using for the given scenarios.\nIndividual error codes are also specified along with their respective error messages.\n\n- `unknown-user`\n- `too-low-difficulty`\n- `stale-share`\n- `unsupported-feature-flags`\n- `unsupported-protocol`\n- `protocol-version-mismatch`\n\n## 3.6 Common Protocol Messages\n\nThe following protocol messages are common across all of the protocols described in this BIP.\n\n### 3.6.1 `SetupConnection` (Client -> Server)\n\nInitiates the connection.\nThis MUST be the first message sent by the client on the newly opened connection.\nServer MUST respond with either a `SetupConnection.Success` or `SetupConnection.Error` message.\nClients that are not configured to provide telemetry data to the upstream node SHOULD set `device_id` to 0-length strings.\nHowever, they MUST always set vendor to a string describing the manufacturer/developer and firmware version and SHOULD always set `hardware_version` to a string describing, at least, the particular hardware/software package in use.\n\n| Field Name         | Data Type | Description                                                                                                                 |\n|--------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| protocol           | U8        | 0 = Mining Protocol <br>1 = Job Declaration <br>2 = Template Distribution Protocol                                          |\n| min_version        | U16       | The minimum protocol version the client supports (currently must be 2)                                                      |\n| max_version        | U16       | The maximum protocol version the client supports (currently must be 2)                                                      |\n| flags              | U32       | Flags indicating optional protocol features the client supports.

For an empty block, the Coinbase transaction MAY have a witness and the `OP_RETURN` output with the witness commitment anyway.\n\nThe `OP_RETURN` output with the witness commitment is provided by Sv2 Template Providers in the `coinbase_tx_outputs` field of `NewTemplate` message.\n\nOn a serialized SegWit transaction, the BIP141 fields are:\n- marker\n- flag\n- witness count\n- witness length\n- witness\n\nThe presence or absence of these fields on a serialized Coinbase has important implications on the Stratum V2 protocol. More specifically, the following messages are affected:\n- `NewExtendedMiningJob` of Mining Protocol\n- `DeclareMiningJob` of Job Declaration Protocol\n- `SubmitSolution` of Template Distribution Protocol\n- `NewTemplate` of Template Distribution Protocol\n\n### 3.7.1 BIP141 on `NewExtendedMiningJob`\n\nOn the Mining Protocol's `NewExtendedMiningJob` there are two fields affected by BIP141:\n- `coinbase_tx_prefix`\n- `coinbase_tx_suffix`\n\nWhen concatenated with `extranonce_prefix` + `extranonce`, these fields form a serialized Coinbase transaction that is then hashed to produce a `txid`. Together with `merkle_path`, this `txid`\nwill then form the `merkle_root` of the Block Header.\n\nIn case the Template's Coinbase is a SegWit transaction, BIP141 fields MUST be stripped away from `coinbase_tx_prefix` and `coinbase_tx_suffix`, otherwise clients would be calculating a `merkle_root` with the Coinbase's `wtxid`, which goes against Bitcoin Consensus.\n\nThe server MUST retain the original value of those fields so that it can reconstruct the Coinbase as a SegWit transaction whenever it needs to propagate a block.\n\n### 3.7.2 BIP141 on `DeclareMiningJob`\n\nOn the Job Declaration Protocol's `DeclareMiningJob` there are two fields affected by BIP141:\n- `coinbase_tx_prefix`\n- `coinbase_tx_suffix`\n\nDifferently from `NewExtendedMiningJob`, in case the Template's Coinbase is a SegWit transaction, BIP141 fields MUST NOT be stripped from `DeclareMiningJob`'s `coinbase_tx_prefix` and `coinbase_tx_suffix`.\n\nThat's because JDS needs to be able to reconstruct the Coinbase as a SegWit transaction whenever it needs to propagate a block.\n\n### 3.7.3 BIP141 on `SubmitSolution`\n\nOn the Template Distribution Protocol's `SubmitSolution` there is one field affected by BIP141:\n- `coinbase_tx`\n\nDifferently from `NewExtendedMiningJob`, in case the Template's Coinbase is a SegWit transaction, BIP141 fields MUST NOT be stripped from `SubmitSolution`'s `coinbase_tx`.\n\nThat's because the Template Distribution Server would not be able to propagate a block without that data.\n\n### 3.7.4. BIP141 on `NewTemplate`\n\nOn the Template Distribution Protocol's `NewTemplate` there is one field affected by BIP141:\n- `coinbase_tx_outputs`\n\nIn case of blocks containing SegWit transactions (and optionally blocks that don't as well), this field carries the `OP_RETURN` output with the witness commitment. The `witness reserved value` (Coinbase witness) used for calculating this witness commitment is assumed to be 32 bytes of `0x00`, as it currently holds no consensus-critical meaning. This [may change in future soft-forks](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#extensible-commitment-structure).",
    "html": "<h1>3. Protocol Overview</h1>\n<p>There are technically three distinct (sub)protocols needed in order to fully use all of the features proposed in this document:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mining Protocol</strong><br>\nThe main protocol used for mining and the direct successor of Stratum v1.\nA mining device uses it to communicate with its upstream node, pool, or a proxy.\nA proxy uses it to communicate with a pool (or another proxy).\nThis protocol needs to be implemented in all scenarios.\nFor cases in which a miner or pool does not support transaction selection, this is the only protocol used.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Job Declaration Protocol</strong><br>\nUsed by a miner (a whole mining farm) to declare a block template with a pool.\nResults of this declaration can be re-used for all mining connections to the pool to reduce computational intensity.\nIn other words, a single declaration can be used by an entire mining farm or even multiple farms with hundreds of thousands of devices, making it far more efficient.\nThis is separate to allow pools to terminate such connections on separate infrastructure from mining protocol connections (i.e. share submissions).\nFurther, such connections have very different concerns from share submissions - work declaration likely requires, at a minimum, some spot-checking of work validity, as well as potentially substantial rate-limiting (without the inherent rate-limiting of share difficulty).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Template Distribution Protocol</strong><br>\nA similarly-framed protocol for getting information about the next block out of Bitcoin Core.\nDesigned to replace <code>getblocktemplate</code> with something much more efficient and easy to implement for those implementing other parts of Stratum v2.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Meanwhile, there are five possible roles (types of software/hardware) for communicating with these protocols.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mining Device</strong><br>\nThe actual device computing the hashes. This can be further divided into header-only mining devices and standard mining devices, though most devices will likely support both modes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pool Service</strong><br>\nProduces jobs (for those not declaring jobs via the Job Declaration Protocol), validates shares, and ensures blocks found by clients are propagated through the network (though clients which have full block templates MUST also propagate blocks into the Bitcoin P2P network).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mining Proxy (optional)</strong><br>\nSits in between Mining Device(s) and Pool Service, aggregating connections for efficiency.\nMay optionally provide additional monitoring, receive work from a Job Declarator and use custom work with a pool, or provide other services for a farm.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Job Declarator (optional)</strong><br>\nIt is further divided into a Job Declarator Client and a Job Declarator Server.\nThe Job Declarator Client receives custom block templates from a Template Provider and declares use of them with the Job Declarator Server (which is typically Pool side) using the Job Declaration Protocol.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Template Provider</strong><br>\nGenerates custom block templates to be passed to the Job Declarator for eventual mining.\nThis is usually just a Bitcoin Core full node (or possibly some other node implementation).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Mining Protocol is used for communication between a Mining Device and Pool Service, Mining Device and Mining Proxy, Mining Proxy and Mining Proxy, or Mining Proxy and Pool Service.</p>\n<p>The Job Declaration Protocol is used for communication between a Job Declarator Client and a Job Declarator Server (which is typically Pool side).</p>\n<p>The Template Distribution Protocol is used for communication either between a Job Declarator Client and a Template Provider or between a Pool Service and Template Provider.</p>\n<p>One type of software/hardware can fulfill more than one role (e.g. a Mining Proxy is often both a Mining Proxy and a Job Declarator and may occasionally further contain a Template Provider in the form of a full node on the same device).</p>\n<p>Each sub-protocol is based on the same technical principles and requires a connection oriented transport layer, such as TCP.\nIn specific use cases, it may make sense to operate the protocol over a connectionless transport with FEC or local broadcast with retransmission.\nHowever, that is outside of the scope of this document.\nThe minimum requirement of the transport layer is to guarantee ordered delivery of the protocol messages.</p>\n<h2>3.1 Data Types Mapping</h2>\n<p>Message definitions use common data types described here for convenience.\nMultibyte data types are always serialized as little-endian.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Data Type</th>\n<th>Byte Length</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>BOOL</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Boolean value.

This extension must be included in any protocol implementation that plans to support additional protocol extensions.</p>\n<p>Extensions MUST require negotiation with the recipient of the message to check that the extension is supported before sending non-version-negotiation messages for it.\nThis prevents the needlessly wasted bandwidth and potentially serious performance degradation of extension messages when the recipient does not support them.</p>\n<p>See <code>ChannelEndpointChanged</code> message in Common Protocol Messages for details about how extensions interact with dynamic channel reconfiguration in proxies.</p>\n<h2>3.4.1 Stratum V2 TLV Encoding Model</h2>\n<p>To ensure a consistent and extensible way of adding optional fields to existing messages, <strong>Stratum V2 supports Type-Length-Value (TLV) encoding</strong> for protocol extensions. This model allows for structured, backward-compatible extensions while ensuring that unknown fields can be safely ignored.</p>\n<h3>TLV Structure</h3>\n<p>Each TLV-encoded field follows this format:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Field</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Size</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Description</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Type</strong></td>\n<td>3 bytes (U16 + U8)</td>\n<td>Identifies the TLV field.

If a TLV field exceeds the maximum length allowed by its specification, the recipient MUST reject the message.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example: Extending <code>SubmitSharesExtended</code></h3>\n<p>If extension <strong>0x0002</strong> (Worker-Specific Hashrate Tracking) is negotiated, clients must append the following TLV field to <code>SubmitSharesExtended</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>[TYPE: 0x0002 0x01] [LENGTH: 0x000A] [VALUE: &quot;Worker_001&quot;]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Encoded as:</p>\n<pre><code>00 02 01 00 0A 57 6F 72 6B 65 72 5F 30 30 31\n</code></pre>\n<p>Where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>00 02 01</code> → TLV Type (Extension <code>0x0002</code>, Field <code>0x01</code> — <code>user_identity</code>)</li>\n<li><code>00 0A</code> → Length = 10 bytes</li>\n<li><code>57 6F 72 6B 65 72 5F 30 30 31</code> → <code>&quot;Worker_001&quot;</code> (UTF-8 encoded)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A device processing <code>SubmitSharesExtended</code> <strong>MUST scan for TLV fields</strong> matching any negotiated extensions, allowing for future extensibility without breaking compatibility.</p>\n<h2>3.5 Error Codes</h2>\n<p>The protocol uses string error codes.\nThe list of error codes can differ between implementations, and thus implementations MUST NOT take any automated action(s) on the basis of an error code.\nImplementations/pools SHOULD provide documentation on the meaning of error codes and error codes SHOULD use printable ASCII where possible.\nFurthermore, error codes MUST NOT include control characters.</p>\n<p>To make interoperability simpler, the following error codes are provided which implementations SHOULD consider using for the given scenarios.\nIndividual error codes are also specified along with their respective error messages.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>unknown-user</code></li>\n<li><code>too-low-difficulty</code></li>\n<li><code>stale-share</code></li>\n<li><code>unsupported-feature-flags</code></li>\n<li><code>unsupported-protocol</code></li>\n<li><code>protocol-version-mismatch</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.6 Common Protocol Messages</h2>\n<p>The following protocol messages are common across all of the protocols described in this BIP.</p>\n<h3>3.6.1 <code>SetupConnection</code> (Client -&gt; Server)</h3>\n<p>Initiates the connection.\nThis MUST be the first message sent by the client on the newly opened connection.\nServer MUST respond with either a <code>SetupConnection.Success</code> or <code>SetupConnection.Error</code> message.\nClients that are not configured to provide telemetry data to the upstream node SHOULD set <code>device_id</code> to 0-length strings.\nHowever, they MUST always set vendor to a string describing the manufacturer/developer and firmware version and SHOULD always set <code>hardware_version</code> to a string describing, at least, the particular hardware/software package in use.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field Name</th>\n<th>Data Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>protocol</td>\n<td>U8</td>\n<td>0 = Mining Protocol <br>1 = Job Declaration <br>2 = Template Distribution Protocol</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>min_version</td>\n<td>U16</td>\n<td>The minimum protocol version the client supports (currently must be 2)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>max_version</td>\n<td>U16</td>\n<td>The maximum protocol version the client supports (currently must be 2)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>flags</td>\n<td>U32</td>\n<td>Flags indicating optional protocol features the client supports.

    "content": "# 4 Protocol Security\n\nStratum V2 employs a type of encryption scheme called AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data) to address the security aspects of all communication that occurs between clients and servers.\nThis provides both confidentiality and integrity for the ciphertexts (i.e. encrypted data) being transferred, as well as providing integrity for associated data which is not encrypted.\nPrior to opening any Stratum V2 channels for mining, clients MUST first initiate the cryptographic session state that is used to encrypt all messages sent between themselves and servers.\nThus, the cryptographic session state is independent of V2 messaging conventions.\n\nAt the same time, this specification proposes optional use of a particular handshake protocol based on the **[Noise Protocol framework](https://noiseprotocol.org/noise.html)**.\nThe client and server establish secure communication using Diffie-Hellman (DH) key agreement, as described in greater detail in the Authenticated Key Agreement Handshake section below.\n\nUsing the handshake protocol to establish secured communication is **optional** on the local network (e.g. local mining devices talking to a local mining proxy).\nHowever, it is **mandatory** for remote access to the upstream nodes, whether they be pool mining services, job declarating services or template distributors.\n\n## 4.1 Motivation for Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data\n\nData transferred by the mining protocol MUST not provide an adversary with information that they can use to estimate the performance of any particular miner. Any intelligence about submitted shares can be directly converted to estimations of a miner’s earnings and can be associated with a particular username. This is unacceptable privacy leakage that needs to be addressed.\n\n## 4.2 Motivation for Using the Noise Protocol Framework\n\nThe reasons why Noise Protocol Framework has been chosen are listed below:\n\n- The Framework provides a formalism to describe the handshake protocol that can be verified.\n- A custom certificate scheme is now possible (no need to use x509 certificates).\n\n## 4.3 Choice of cryptographic primitives\n\nNoise encrypted session requires Elliptic Curve (EC), Hash function (`HASH()`) and cipher function that supports AEAD mode<sup>[1](#reference-1)</sup>.\n\nThis specification describes mandatory cryptographic primitives that each implementation needs to support.\nThese primitives are chosen so that Noise Encryption layer for Stratum V2 can be implemented using primitives already present in Bitcoin Core project at the time of writing this spec.\n\n### 4.3.1 Elliptic Curve\n\n- Bitcoin's secp256k1 curve<sup>[2](#reference-2)</sup> is used\n- Schnorr signature scheme is used as described in BIP340<sup>[3](#reference-3)</sup>\n\n#### 4.3.1.1 EC point encoding remarks\n\nSecp256k1 curve points, i.e. Public Keys, are points with of X- and Y-coordinate.\nWe serialize them in three different ways, only using the x-coordinate.\n\n1. When signing or verifying a certificate, we use the 32 byte x-only\nencoding as defined in BIP 340.<sup>[3](#reference-3)</sup>.\n\n2. When sharing keys during the handshake, whether in plain text or encrypted,\nwe use the 64 byte ElligatorSwift x-only encoding as defined in BIP324<sup>[7](#reference-7)</sup> under \"ElligatorSwift encoding of curve X coordinates\". This encoding uses 64-bytes instead of 32-bytes in order to produce a\npseudo-random bytesteam. This is useful because the protocol handshake starts with\neach side sending their public key in plain text. Additionally the use of X-only\nElligatorSwift ECDH removes the need to grind or negate private keys.\n\n3. The Authority public key is base58-check encoded as described in 4.7.\n\nDigital signatures are serialized in 64-bytes like in BIP340<sup>[3](#reference-3)</sup>.\n\nKey generation algorithm:\n\n1. generate random 32-byte secret key `sk`\n2. let `d' = int(sk)`\n3. fail if `d = 0` or `d' > n` where `n` is group order of secp256k1 curve\n4. compute `P` as `d'⋅G`\n5. drop the Y coordinate and compute (u, t) = XElligatorSwift(P.x)\n6. ellswift_pub = bytes(u) || bytes(t)\n7. output keypair `(sk, ellswift_pub)`\n\nTo perform X-only ECDH we use ellswift_ecdh_xonly(ellswift_theirs, d) as described in BIP324<sup>[7](#reference-7)</sup> under \"Shared secret computation\". The result is 32 bytes.\n\nNo assumption is made about the parity of Y-coordinate. For the purpose of signing\n(e.g. certificate) and ECDH (handshake) it is _not_ necessary to \"grind\"\nthe private key. The choosen algoritms take care of this by implicitly negating\nthe key, as if its public key had an even Y-coordinate.\n\nFor more information refer to BIP340<sup>[3](#reference-3)</sup> and BIP324<sup>[7](#reference-7)</sup>.\n\n### 4.3.2 Hash function\n\n- `SHA-256()` is used as a `HASH()`\n\n### 4.3.3 Cipher function for authenticated encryption\n\n- Cipher has methods for encryption and decryption for key `k`, nonce `n`, associated_data `ad`, plaintext `pt` and ciphertext `ct`\n  - `ENCRYPT(k, n, ad, pt)`\n  - `DECRYPT(k, n, ad, ct)`\n- ChaCha20 and Poly1305 in AEAD mode<sup>[4](#reference-4)</sup> (ChaChaPoly) is used as a default AEAD cipher\n\n## 4.4 Cryptographic operations\n\n### 4.4.1 CipherState object\n\nObject that encapsulates encryption and decryption operations with underlying AEAD mode cipher functions using 32-byte encryption key `k` and 8-byte nonce `n`.\nCipherState has the following interface:\n\n- `InitializeKey(key)`:\n  - Sets `k = key`, `n = 0`\n- `EncryptWithAd(ad, plaintext)`\n  - If `k` is non-empty, performs `ENCRYPT(k, n++, ad, plaintext)` on the underlying cipher function, otherwise returns `plaintext`. The `++` post-increment operator applied to `n` means: \"use the current n value, then increment it\".\n  - Where `ENCRYPT` is an evaluation of `ChaCha20-Poly1305` (IETF variant) with the passed arguments, with nonce `n` encoded as 32 zero bits, followed by a _little-endian_ 64-bit value. Note: this follows the Noise Protocol convention, rather than our normal endian.\n- `DecryptWithAd(ad, ciphertext)`\n  - If `k` is non-empty performs `DECRYPT(k, n++, ad, plaintext)` on the underlying cipher function, otherwise returns ciphertext. If an authentication failure occurs in `DECRYPT()` then `n` is not incremented and an error is signaled to the caller.\n  - Where `DECRYPT` is an evaluation of `ChaCha20-Poly1305` (IETF variant) with the passed arguments, with nonce `n` encoded as 32 zero bits, followed by a _little-endian_ 64-bit value.\n\n### 4.4.2 Handshake Operation\n\nThroughout the handshake process, each side maintains these variables:\n\n- `ck`: **chaining key**. Accumulated hash of all previous ECDH outputs. At the end of the handshake `ck` is used to derive encryption key `k`.\n- `h`: **handshake hash**.

Ephemeral key and remote party's ephemeral key, respectively.\n- `s`, `rs` **static keys**. Static key and remote party's static key, respectively.\n\nThe following functions will also be referenced:\n\n- `generateKey()`: generates and returns a fresh `secp256k1` keypair\n\n  - Where the object returned by `generateKey` has two attributes:\n    - `.public_key`, which returns an abstract object representing the public key\n    - `.private_key`, which represents the private key used to generate the public key\n  - Where the public_key object also has a single method:\n    - `.serializeEllSwift()` that outputs a 64-byte EllSwift encoded serialization of the X-coordinate of EC point (the Y-coordinate is ignored)\n\n- `a || b` denotes the concatenation of two byte strings `a` and `b`\n\n- `HMAC-HASH(key, data)`\n\n  - Applies HMAC defined in `RFC 2104`<sup>[5](#reference-5)</sup>\n  - In our case where the key is always 32 bytes, this reduces down to:\n    - pad the key with zero bytes to fill the hash block (block length is 64 bytes in case of SHA-256): `k' = k || <zero-bytes>`\n    - calculate `temp = SHA-256((k' XOR ipad) || data)` where ipad is repeated 0x36 byte\n    - output `SHA-256((k' XOR opad) || temp)` where opad is repeated 0x5c byte\n\n- `HKDF(chaining_key, input_key_material)`: a function defined in `RFC 5869`<sup>[6](#reference-6)</sup>, evaluated with a zero-length `info` field and 2 `num_output` field:\n\n  - Sets `temp_key = HMAC-HASH(chaining_key, input_key_material)`\n  - Sets `output1 = HMAC-HASH(temp_key, byte(0x01))`\n  - Sets `output2 = HMAC-HASH(temp_key, output1 || byte(0x02))`\n  - Returns the pair `(output1, output2)`\n\n- `MixKey(input_key_material)`: Executes the following steps:\n\n  - sets `(ck, temp_k) = HKDF(ck, input_key_material, 2)`\n  - calls `InitializeKey(temp_k)`\n\n- `MixHash(data)`: Sets `h = HASH(h || data)`\n\n- `EncryptAndHash(plaintext)`:\n\n  - If `k` is non-empty sets `ciphertext = EncryptWithAd(h, plaintext)`, otherwise `ciphertext = plaintext`\n  - Calls `MixHash(ciphertext)`\n  - returns `ciphertext`\n\n- `DecryptAndHash(ciphertext)`:\n\n  - If `k` is non-empty sets `plaintext = DecryptWithAd(h, ciphertext)`, otherwise `plaintext = ciphertext`\n  - Calls `MixHash(ciphertext)`\n  - returns `plaintext`\n\n- `ECDH(k, rk)`: performs an Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman operation\n  using `k`, which is a   valid `secp256k1` private key, and `rk`, which is a EllSwift\n  encoded public key\n  - The output is 32 bytes\n  - It is a shortcut for performing operation `v2_ecdh` defined in BIP324<sup>[7](#reference-7)</sup>:\n    - let `k, ellswift_k` be key pair created by `ellswift_create()` function\n    - let `rk` be remote public key **encoded as ellswift**.\n    - let `initiator` be bool flag that is **true** if the party performing ECDH initiated the handshake\n    - then `ECDH(k, rk) = v2_ecdh(k, ellswift_k, rk, initiator)`\n\n- `v2_ecdh(k, ellswift_k, rk, initiator)`: \n  - let `ecdh_point_x32` = `ellswift_ecdh_xonly(rk, k)`\n  - if initiator == true:\n    - return `tagged_hash(ellswift_k, rk, ecdh_point_x32)`\n    - else return `tagged_hash(rk, ellswift_k, ecdh_point_x32)`\n  - **Note that the ecdh result is not commutative with respect to roles!

NX-handshake part 1: `-> e`\n2. NX-handshake part 2: `<- e, ee, s, es, SIGNATURE_NOISE_MESSAGE`\n3. Server authentication: Initiator validates authenticity of server using from `SIGNATURE_NOISE_MESSAGE`\n\nShould the decryption (i.e. authentication code validation) fail at any point, the session must be terminated.\n\n### 4.5.1 Handshake Act 1: NX-handshake part 1 `-> e`\n\nPrior to starting first round of NX-handshake, both initiator and responder initializes handshake variables `h` (hash output), `ck` (chaining key) and `k` (encryption key):\n\n1. **hash output** `h = HASH(protocolName)`\n\n- Since `protocolName` more than 32 bytes in length, apply `HASH` to it.\n- `protocolName` is official Noise Protocol name: `Noise_NX_Secp256k1+EllSwift_ChaChaPoly_SHA256`\n  encoded as an ASCII string\n\n2. **chaining key** `ck = h`\n3. **hash output** `h = HASH(h)`\n4. **encryption key** `k ` empty\n\n#### 4.5.1.1 Initiator\n\nInitiator generates ephemeral keypair and sends the public key to the responder:\n\n1. initializes empty output buffer\n2. generates ephemeral keypair `e`, appends `e.public_key.serializeEllSwift()` to the buffer (64 bytes plaintext EllSwift encoded public key)\n3. calls `MixHash(e.public_key)`\n4. calls `EncryptAndHash()` with empty payload and appends the ciphertext to the buffer (note that _k_ is empty at this point, so this effectively reduces down to `MixHash()` on empty data)\n5. submits the buffer for sending to the responder in the following format\n\n##### Ephemeral public key message:\n\n| Field name | Description                      |\n| ---------- | -------------------------------- |\n| PUBKEY     | Initiator's ephemeral public key |\n\nMessage length: 64 bytes\n\n#### 4.5.1.2 Responder\n\n1. receives ephemeral public key message (64 bytes plaintext EllSwift encoded public key)\n2. parses received public key as `re.public_key`\n3. calls `MixHash(re.public_key)`\n4. calls `DecryptAndHash()` on remaining bytes (i.e. on empty data with empty _k_, thus effectively only calls `MixHash()` on empty data)\n\n### 4.5.2 Handshake Act 2: NX-handshake part 2 `<- e, ee, s, es, SIGNATURE_NOISE_MESSAGE`\n\nResponder provides its ephemeral, encrypted static public keys and encrypted `SIGNATURE_NOISE_MESSAGE` to the initiator, performs Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman operations.\n\n##### SIGNATURE_NOISE_MESSAGE\n\n| Field Name      | Data Type | Description                                                    |\n| --------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| version         | U16       | Version of the certificate format                              |\n| valid_from      | U32       | Validity start time (unix timestamp)                           |\n| not_valid_after | U32       | Signature is invalid after this point in time (unix timestamp) |\n| signature       | SIGNATURE | Certificate signature                                          |\n\nLength: 74 bytes\n\n#### 4.5.2.1 Responder\n\n1. initializes empty output buffer\n2. generates ephemeral keypair `e`, appends `e.public_key` to the buffer (64 bytes plaintext EllSwift encoded public key)\n3. calls `MixHash(e.public_key)`\n4. calls `MixKey(ECDH(e.private_key, re.public_key))`\n5. appends `EncryptAndHash(s.public_key)` (64 bytes encrypted EllSwift encoded public key, 16 bytes MAC)\n6. calls `MixKey(ECDH(s.private_key, re.public_key))`\n7. appends `EncryptAndHash(SIGNATURE_NOISE_MESSAGE)` to the buffer\n8. submits the buffer for sending to the initiator\n9. return pair of CipherState objects, the first for encrypting transport messages from initiator to responder, and the second for messages in the other direction:\n   1. sets `temp_k1, temp_k2 = HKDF(ck, zerolen, 2)`\n   2. creates two new CipherState objects `c1` and `c2`\n   3. calls `c1.InitializeKey(temp_k1)` and `c2.InitializeKey(temp_k2)`\n   4. returns the pair `(c1, c2)`\n\n##### Message format of NX-handshake part 2\n\n| Field name              | Description                                                                                                                                                    |\n| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| PUBKEY                  | Responder's plaintext ephemeral public key                                                                                                                     |\n| PUBKEY                  | Responder's encrypted static public key                                                                                                                        |\n| MAC                     | Message authentication code for responder's static public key                                                                                                  |\n| SIGNATURE_NOISE_MESSAGE | Signed message containing Responder's static key.

These parts make up a `CERTIFICATE` signed by an authority whose public key is generally known (for example from pool's website). Initiator confirms the identity of the server by verifying the signature in the certificate.\n\n##### CERTIFICATE\n\n| Field Name           | Data Type | Description                                                    | Signed field |\n| -------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |\n| version              | U16       | Version of the certificate format                              | YES          |\n| valid_from           | U32       | Validity start time (unix timestamp)                           | YES          |\n| not_valid_after      | U32       | Signature is invalid after this point in time (unix timestamp) | YES          |\n| server_public_key    | PUBKEY    | Server's static public key that was used during NX handshake   | YES          |\n| authority_public_key | PUBKEY    | Certificate authority's public key that signed this message    | NO           |\n| signature            | SIGNATURE | Signature over the serialized fields marked for signing        | NO           |\n\nThis message is not sent directly. Instead, it is constructed from SIGNATURE_NOISE_MESSAGE and server's static public\nkey that are sent during the handshake process\n\nThe PUBKEY fields are encoded using only their 32 byte x-coordinate and _not_ with\nEllSwift. For the purpose of generating and verifying the certificate, the 64 byte\nEllSwift encoded server_public_key can be decoded to its 32 byte x-coordinate.\n\n#### 4.5.3.1 Signature structure\n\nSchnorr signature with _key prefixing_ is used<sup>[3](#reference-3)</sup>\n\nsignature is constructed for\n\n- message `m`, where `m` is `HASH` of the serialized fields of the `CERTIFICATE` that are marked for signing, i.e. `m = SHA-256(version || valid_from || not_valid_after || server_public_key)`\n- public key `P` that is Certificate Authority\n\nSignature itself is concatenation of an EC point `R` and an integer `s` (note that each item is serialized as 32 bytes array) for which identity `s⋅G = R + HASH(R || P || m)⋅P` holds.\n\n## 4.6 Encrypted stratum message framing\n\nAfter handshake process is finished, both initiator and responder have CipherState objects for encryption and decryption and after initiator validated server's identity, any subsequent traffic is encrypted and decrypted with `EncryptWithAd()` and `DecryptWithAd()` methods of the respective CipherState objects with zero-length associated data.\n\nMaximum transport message length (ciphertext) for a Noise Protocol message is 65535 bytes.\n\nSince Stratum Message Frame consists of\n- fixed length message header: 6 bytes\n- variable length serialized stratum message\n\nStratum Message header and stratum message payload are processed separately.\n\n#### Encrypting stratum message\n1. serialize stratum message into a plaintext binary string (payload)\n2. prepare the frame header for the Stratum message `message_length` is the length of the plaintext payload.\n3. encrypt and concatenate serialized header and payload:\n   4. `EncryptWithAd([], header)` - 22 bytes\n   5. `EncryptWithAd([], payload)` - variable length encrypted message\n4. concatenate resulting header and payload ciphertext\n\n- Note: The `message_length` (payload_length) in the encrypted Stratum message header always reflects the plaintext payload size. The size of the encrypted payload is implicitly understood to be message_length + MAC size for each block. This simplifies the decryption process and ensures clarity in interpreting frame data.\n\n#### Decrypting stratum message\n1. read exactly 22 bytes and decrypt into stratum frame or fail\n2. The value `frame.message_length` should first be converted to the ciphertext length, and then that amount of data should be read and decrypted into plaintext payload. If decryption fails, the process stops\n3. deserialize plaintext payload into stratum message given by `frame.extension_type` and `frame.message_type` or fail\n\n\n*converting plaintext length to ciphertext length:\n```c\n#define MAX_CT_LEN 65535\n#define MAC_LEN 16\n#define MAX_PT_LEN (MAX_CT_LEN - MAC_LEN)\n\nuint pt_len_to_ct_len(uint pt_len) {\n        uint remainder;\n        remainder = pt_len % MAX_PT_LEN;\n        if (remainder > 0) {\n                remainder += MAC_LEN;\n        }\n        return pt_len / MAX_PT_LEN * MAX_CT_LEN + remainder;\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Encrypted stratum message frame layout\n```\n+--------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Extended Noise header                            | Encrypted stratum-message payload                                 |\n+--------------------------------------------------+-------------------+-------------------+---------------------------+\n| Header AEAD ciphertext                           | Noise block 1     | Noise block 2     | Last Noise block          |\n| 22 Bytes                                         | 65535 Bytes       | 65535 Bytes       | 17 - 65535 Bytes          |\n+----------------------------------------+---------+-----------+-------+-----------+-------+---------------+-----------+\n| Encrypted Stratum message Header       | MAC     | ct_pld_1  | MAC_1 | ct_pld_2  | MAC_2 | ct_pld_rest   | MAC_rest  |\n| 6 Bytes                                | 16 B    | 65519 B   | 16 B  | 65519 B   | 16 B  | 1 - 65519 B   | 16 Bytes  |\n+================+==========+============+=========+===========+=======+===========+=======+===============+===========+\n| extension_type | msg_type | pld_length | <padd   | pt_pld_1  | <padd | pt_pld_2  | <padd | pt_pld_rest   | <padding> |\n| U16            | U8       | U24        |   ing>  | 65519 B   |  ing> | 65519 B   |  ing> | 1 - 65519 B   |           |\n+----------------+----------+------------+---------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nThe `pld_length` field in the Encrypted Stratum message Header now consistently represents the plaintext length of the payload.\nSerialized stratum-v2 body (payload) is split into 65519-byte chunks and encrypted to form 65535-bytes AEAD ciphertexts,\nwhere `ct_pld_N` is the N-th ciphertext block of payload and `pt_pld_N` is the N-th plaintext block of payload.\n```\n\n## 4.7 URL Scheme and Pool Authority Key\n\nDownstream nodes that want to use the above outlined security scheme need to have configured the **Pool Authority Public Key** of the pool that they intend to connect to.

Mining Protocol\n\nThe Mining Protocol enables the distribution of work to mining devices and the submission of proof-of-work results.\n\nIt can be used without Job Declaration and Template Distribution Protocols, where a subset of the messages are used by a pool to unilaterally distribute work to miners.\n\nAlternatively, it can be used in conjunction with Job Declaration and Template Distribution Protocols, where both pool and miners coordinate to decide what is valid work.\n\n## 5.1 Job\n\nA **Job** consists of a unit of work containing all the necessary information about the hashing space over some candidate block header.\n\nEach Mining Device has to work on a unique part of the whole search space.\nThe full search space is defined in part by valid values in the following block header fields:\n\n- `nonce` header field (32 bits)\n- `version` header field (16 bits, as specified by [BIP 320](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0320.mediawiki))\n- `nTime` header field (32 bits timestamp, limited under [`MAX_FUTURE_BLOCK_TIME`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/28ce159bc327e6dfec34077ff2e379b23a95db65/src/chain.h#L29))\n\nThe other portion of the block header that is used to define the full search space is the Merkle Root, which is deterministically computed from:\n- Coinbase transaction\n- Transaction set\n\nAll roles in Stratum v2 MUST NOT use transaction selection/ordering for additional hash space extension.\nThis stems both from the concept that miners/pools should be able to choose their transaction set freely without any interference with the protocol, and also to enable future protocol modifications to Bitcoin.\nIn other words, any rules imposed on transaction selection/ordering by miners not described in the rest of this document may result in invalid work.\n\nMining servers MUST assign a unique subset of the search space to each mining device, otherwise the mining devices will waste energy with overlapping search.\n\nThis protocol explicitly expects that upstream server software is able to manage the size of the hashing space correctly for its clients and can provide new and unique Jobs quickly enough, based on the hashpower of each client.\n\nThe protocol defines two main types of Jobs: **Standard Job** and **Extended Job**.\n\nThis separation vastly simplifies the protocol implementation for clients that don’t support Extended Job, as they only need to implement the subset of protocol messages related to Standard Job (see Mining Protocol Messages for details).\n\nAdditionally, a Job (either Standard or Extended) also could be potentially labeled as a **Future Job** and/or **Custom Job**.\n\n### 5.1.1 Standard Job\n\nStandard Jobs are restricted to fixed Merkle Roots, where the only modifiable bits are under the `version`, `nonce`, and `nTime` fields of the block header.\n\nWe call this header-only mining (HOM), and it is the smallest assignable unit of search space by the protocol.\n\nThe size of the search space for one Standard Job, given a fixed `nTime` field, is `2^(NONCE_BITS + BIP320_VERSION_ROLLING_BITS) = ~280Th`, where `NONCE_BITS = 32` and `BIP320_VERSION_ROLLING_BITS = 16`.\nThis is a guaranteed space before `nTime` rolling (or changing the Merkle Root by sending a new Job).\n\nStandard Jobs are distributed via the [`NewMiningJob`](#5315-newminingjob-server---client) message, which can ONLY be sent via [Standard Channels](#521-standard-channels).\n\nNote that Mining Devices with hashrate above 280 TH/s will outrun the true time when rolling the `nTime` field. This is not necessarily a problem, as long as the Job remains valid within the limits defined by the `MAX_FUTURE_BLOCK_TIME` constant of the Bitcoin protocol (2 hours).\n\nDepending on the hashrate of the Mining Device, it must receive new Standard Jobs (with a different Merkle Root) frequently enough in order to avoid rolling `nTime` too much ahead of the true time (which could result in rejected work).\n\n![](./img/standard_job.png)\n\n### 5.1.2 Extended Job\n\nExtended Jobs allow rolling Merkle Roots, giving extensive control over the search space so that they can implement various advanced use cases such as:\n- translation between Sv1 and Sv2 protocols\n- difficulty aggregation\n- search space splitting\n\nExtended Jobs are distributed via the [`NewExtendedMiningJob`](#5416-newextendedminingjob-server---client) message, which can be sent via:\n- [Group Channels](#523-group-channels)\n- [Extended Channels](#522-extended-channels)\n\n![](./img/extended_job.png)\n\n#### 5.1.2.1 Extended Extranonce\n\nDownstream and Upstream are relative terms. There could theoretically be multiple nested layers of Stratum Nodes (e.g.: Proxies) between a Work-Providing Node and a Mining Device.\n\nSo the protocol establishes the notion of **Extended Extranonce**, which is a fundamental component of Extended Jobs.\n\nThe Extended Extranonce is an array of bytes, split into three different areas:\n\n![](./img/extended_extranonce.png)\n\n- The `extranonce_prefix` bytes are reserved for the upstream layer, where fixed bytes were already established for the Extranonce and are no longer available for rolling or search space splitting.\n- The **locally reserved** bytes is where the local layer will assign unique values for its own downstream clients, according to their hashpower.\n- The **downstream reserved** bytes is where the downstream clients will further distribute the search space, or use for rolling (if they are Mining Devices).\n\n![](./img/extended_extranonce_layers.png)\n\nIn order to calculate the Merkle Root, an Extended Job carries the following data:\n- `merkle_path`\n- `coinbase_tx_prefix`\n- `coinbase_tx_suffix`\n\nAn [Extended Channel](#532-extended-channels) has the following properties:\n- `extranonce_prefix`: the Extended Extranonce bytes that were already allocated by the upstream server.\n- `extranonce_size`: how many bytes are available for the locally reserved and downstream reserved areas of the Extended Extranonce.\n\nAnd a [Standard Channel](#531-standard-channels) has the following property:\n- `extranonce_prefix` the Extended Extranonce bytes that were already allocated by the upstream server.\n\nSo when some layer receives an Extended Job, it could either:\n- propagate it as an Extended Job to a downstream Extended or Group Channel (via `NewExtendedMiningJob` notification), where the Extended Extranonce will be further split.\n- convert it into multiple Standard Job notifications (`NewMiningJob`), where each downstream Standard Channel's `extranonce_prefix` is combined with `coinbase_tx_prefix` + `coinbase_tx_suffix`.\n\nFor conversion into Standard Jobs, the Coinbase Transaction is constructed by concatenating these fields in this specific order: `coinbase_tx_prefix + extranonce_prefix + coinbase_tx_suffix`.\n\nThe Coinbase Transaction is then combined with the `merkle_path` of the Extended Job to calculate the `merkle_root` for the Standard Job notification (`NewMiningJob`). Since Standard Jobs are HOM, there's no `extranonce_size` field on the Standard Job notification.\n\n### 5.1.3 Future Job\n\nA Job with an empty template or speculated non-empty template can be sent in advance to speedup Job distribution when a new block is found on the network.\n\nThe mining server MAY have precomputed such a Job and is able to pre-distribute it for all active Channels.\nThe only missing information to start to mine on the new block is the new `prev_hash`.\nThis information can be provided independently.\n\nSuch an approach improves the efficiency of the protocol where the upstream node does not waste precious time immediately after a new block is found in the network.\n\nThe trade-off here is that a non-empty Future Job could potentially contain a transaction that was already included in the block that was just propagated on the network, which would lead to an invalid block if successfully mined.\n\nSo mining servers that provide non-empty Future Jobs SHOULD:\n- never send a `SetNewPrevHash` for a Future Job that was later found to contain a conflicting transaction.\n- minimize the probability of Future Jobs containing conflicting transactions (which leads to Future Jobs carrying less profitable templates).\n- after a `SetNewPrevHash` is propagated for a Future Job, provide a non-Future Job for this same `prev_hash` as fast as possible (with a more profitable template).\n\n### 5.1.4 Custom Job\n\nA Custom Job contains a set of transactions that were chosen by the miner instead of being unilaterally imposed by the Pool.\n\nUnder the Job Declaration Protocol, upon request the Job Declarator Server (JDS) sends a `mining_job_token` to the Job Declarator Client.\n\nThis `mining_job_token` is used by JDC for:\n- declaring a Custom Job to JDS (via `DeclareMiningJob` message of Job Declaration Protocol)\n- notifying Pool about a Custom Job (via `SetCustomMiningJob` message of Mining Protocol)\n\nThis is a key feature of Stratum V2 that improves Bitcoin decentralization. Please see Job Declaration Protocol for more details.\n\n## 5.2 Channel\n\nThe Mining Protocol is designed such that downstream Mining Devices open Channels with upstream Stratum Nodes within established Connections.\nThese upstream Stratum Nodes could be actual Work-Providing Nodes (e.g.: Pool, or Job Declarator Client) or simply Proxies that relay messages forward.\n\nEach Channel identifies a dedicated mining session associated with an authorized user.\nUpstream stratum nodes accept work submissions and specify a mining target on a per-channel basis.\n\nThere can theoretically be up to `2^32` open Channels within one Connection. This is however just a theoretical ceiling, and it does not mean that every Connection will be able to fill this full capacity (maybe the search space has already been narrowed).\n\nAll Channels are independent of each other, but share some messages broadcast from the server for higher efficiency (e.g. information about a new `prev_hash`).\nEach Channel is identified by its `channel_id` (`U32`), which is consistent throughout the whole life of the Connection. There MUST NOT be two Channels with the same ID in the same Connection.\n\nA Proxy can either transparently allow its clients to open separate Channels with the server (preferred behavior), or aggregate open connections from downstream devices into its own open channel with the server and translate the messages accordingly (present mainly for allowing v1 proxies).\nBoth options have some practical use cases.\nIn either case, proxies SHOULD aggregate clients' Channels into a smaller number of Connections.\nThis saves network traffic for broadcast messages sent by a server because fewer messages need to be sent in total, which leads to lower latencies as a result.\nAnd it further increases efficiency by allowing larger packets to be sent.\n\nThe protocol defines three types of Channels: **Standard Channel**, **Extended Channel** and **Group Channel**, which are useful for different purposes.\n\n### 5.2.1 Standard Channel\n\nStandard Channels are created by end Mining Devices.\n\nWhen an end Mining Device opens a Standard Channel with an upstream, it is restricted to Standard Jobs (via `REQUIRES_STANDARD_JOBS` bit flag of `SetupConnection` message).\n\nHowever, a Proxy could also transparently relay the Standard Channels from the downstream Mining Devices into new upstream Connections. In this case, the `REQUIRES_STANDARD_JOBS` bit flag will not be set for the `SetupConnection` message. This indicates that on this Connection, the Standard Channels can be assembled into a Group Channel and receive Extended Jobs for efficient distribution downstream.\n\nThen, the Connections between the Proxy and Mining Devices will receive Standard Jobs that were efficiently distributed from the Extended Jobs. The Merkle Root of each Standard Job is calculated by the Proxy, taking in consideration the `extranonce_prefix` that was assigned to each Standard Channel, plus the `coinbase_tx_prefix` and the `coinbase_tx_suffix` that were sent on the Extended Job. No `extranonce` field is used in this scenario.\n\n### 5.2.2 Extended Channel\n\nExtended Channels are intended to be used by Proxies for a more efficient distribution of hashing space.\n\nAn Extended Channel carries the following properties:\n- `extranonce_prefix`: the Extended Extranonce bytes that were already allocated by the upstream server.\n- `extranonce_size`: how many bytes are available for the locally reserved and downstream reserved areas of the Extended Extranonce.\n\nUpstream servers which accept connections and provide work MUST support Extended Channels.\nClients, on the other hand, do not have to support Extended Channels, as they MAY be implemented more simply with only Standard Channels at the end-device level.\nThus, upstream servers providing work MUST also support Standard Channels.\n\nThe size of search space for an Extended Channel is `2^(nonce_bits + version_rolling_bits + extranonce_size*8)` per `nTime` value.\n\n### 5.2.3 Group Channel\n\nStandard channels opened within one particular connection can be grouped together to be addressable by a common communication group channel.\n\nWhenever a Standard Channel is created, it is always put into some Group Channel identified by its `group_channel_id`.\nGroup Channel ID namespace is the same as Standard Channel ID namespace on a particular connection.\n\n## 5.3 Mining Protocol Messages\n\n### 5.3.1 `SetupConnection` Flags for Mining Protocol\n\nFlags usable in `SetupConnection.flags` and `SetupConnection.Error::flags`, where bit 0 is the least significant bit of the u32 type:\n\n| Flag Name                | Bit | Description                                                                         |\n|--------------------------| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| REQUIRES_STANDARD_JOBS   | 0   | The downstream node requires standard jobs.

Mining Protocol</h1>\n<p>The Mining Protocol enables the distribution of work to mining devices and the submission of proof-of-work results.</p>\n<p>It can be used without Job Declaration and Template Distribution Protocols, where a subset of the messages are used by a pool to unilaterally distribute work to miners.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, it can be used in conjunction with Job Declaration and Template Distribution Protocols, where both pool and miners coordinate to decide what is valid work.</p>\n<h2>5.1 Job</h2>\n<p>A <strong>Job</strong> consists of a unit of work containing all the necessary information about the hashing space over some candidate block header.</p>\n<p>Each Mining Device has to work on a unique part of the whole search space.\nThe full search space is defined in part by valid values in the following block header fields:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>nonce</code> header field (32 bits)</li>\n<li><code>version</code> header field (16 bits, as specified by <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0320.mediawiki\">BIP 320</a>)</li>\n<li><code>nTime</code> header field (32 bits timestamp, limited under <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/28ce159bc327e6dfec34077ff2e379b23a95db65/src/chain.h#L29\"><code>MAX_FUTURE_BLOCK_TIME</code></a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The other portion of the block header that is used to define the full search space is the Merkle Root, which is deterministically computed from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coinbase transaction</li>\n<li>Transaction set</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All roles in Stratum v2 MUST NOT use transaction selection/ordering for additional hash space extension.\nThis stems both from the concept that miners/pools should be able to choose their transaction set freely without any interference with the protocol, and also to enable future protocol modifications to Bitcoin.\nIn other words, any rules imposed on transaction selection/ordering by miners not described in the rest of this document may result in invalid work.</p>\n<p>Mining servers MUST assign a unique subset of the search space to each mining device, otherwise the mining devices will waste energy with overlapping search.</p>\n<p>This protocol explicitly expects that upstream server software is able to manage the size of the hashing space correctly for its clients and can provide new and unique Jobs quickly enough, based on the hashpower of each client.</p>\n<p>The protocol defines two main types of Jobs: <strong>Standard Job</strong> and <strong>Extended Job</strong>.</p>\n<p>This separation vastly simplifies the protocol implementation for clients that don’t support Extended Job, as they only need to implement the subset of protocol messages related to Standard Job (see Mining Protocol Messages for details).</p>\n<p>Additionally, a Job (either Standard or Extended) also could be potentially labeled as a <strong>Future Job</strong> and/or <strong>Custom Job</strong>.</p>\n<h3>5.1.1 Standard Job</h3>\n<p>Standard Jobs are restricted to fixed Merkle Roots, where the only modifiable bits are under the <code>version</code>, <code>nonce</code>, and <code>nTime</code> fields of the block header.</p>\n<p>We call this header-only mining (HOM), and it is the smallest assignable unit of search space by the protocol.</p>\n<p>The size of the search space for one Standard Job, given a fixed <code>nTime</code> field, is <code>2^(NONCE_BITS + BIP320_VERSION_ROLLING_BITS) = ~280Th</code>, where <code>NONCE_BITS = 32</code> and <code>BIP320_VERSION_ROLLING_BITS = 16</code>.\nThis is a guaranteed space before <code>nTime</code> rolling (or changing the Merkle Root by sending a new Job).</p>\n<p>Standard Jobs are distributed via the <a href=\"#5315-newminingjob-server---client\"><code>NewMiningJob</code></a> message, which can ONLY be sent via <a href=\"#521-standard-channels\">Standard Channels</a>.</p>\n<p>Note that Mining Devices with hashrate above 280 TH/s will outrun the true time when rolling the <code>nTime</code> field. This is not necessarily a problem, as long as the Job remains valid within the limits defined by the <code>MAX_FUTURE_BLOCK_TIME</code> constant of the Bitcoin protocol (2 hours).</p>\n<p>Depending on the hashrate of the Mining Device, it must receive new Standard Jobs (with a different Merkle Root) frequently enough in order to avoid rolling <code>nTime</code> too much ahead of the true time (which could result in rejected work).</p>\n<p><img src=\"./img/standard_job.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3>5.1.2 Extended Job</h3>\n<p>Extended Jobs allow rolling Merkle Roots, giving extensive control over the search space so that they can implement various advanced use cases such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>translation between Sv1 and Sv2 protocols</li>\n<li>difficulty aggregation</li>\n<li>search space splitting</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Extended Jobs are distributed via the <a href=\"#5416-newextendedminingjob-server---client\"><code>NewExtendedMiningJob</code></a> message, which can be sent via:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#523-group-channels\">Group Channels</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#522-extended-channels\">Extended Channels</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"./img/extended_job.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h4>5.1.2.1 Extended Extranonce</h4>\n<p>Downstream and Upstream are relative terms. There could theoretically be multiple nested layers of Stratum Nodes (e.g.: Proxies) between a Work-Providing Node and a Mining Device.</p>\n<p>So the protocol establishes the notion of <strong>Extended Extranonce</strong>, which is a fundamental component of Extended Jobs.</p>\n<p>The Extended Extranonce is an array of bytes, split into three different areas:</p>\n<p><img src=\"./img/extended_extranonce.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>extranonce_prefix</code> bytes are reserved for the upstream layer, where fixed bytes were already established for the Extranonce and are no longer available for rolling or search space splitting.</li>\n<li>The <strong>locally reserved</strong> bytes is where the local layer will assign unique values for its own downstream clients, according to their hashpower.</li>\n<li>The <strong>downstream reserved</strong> bytes is where the downstream clients will further distribute the search space, or use for rolling (if they are Mining Devices).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"./img/extended_extranonce_layers.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In order to calculate the Merkle Root, an Extended Job carries the following data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>merkle_path</code></li>\n<li><code>coinbase_tx_prefix</code></li>\n<li><code>coinbase_tx_suffix</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>An <a href=\"#532-extended-channels\">Extended Channel</a> has the following properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>extranonce_prefix</code>: the Extended Extranonce bytes that were already allocated by the upstream server.</li>\n<li><code>extranonce_size</code>: how many bytes are available for the locally reserved and downstream reserved areas of the Extended Extranonce.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And a <a href=\"#531-standard-channels\">Standard Channel</a> has the following property:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>extranonce_prefix</code> the Extended Extranonce bytes that were already allocated by the upstream server.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So when some layer receives an Extended Job, it could either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>propagate it as an Extended Job to a downstream Extended or Group Channel (via <code>NewExtendedMiningJob</code> notification), where the Extended Extranonce will be further split.</li>\n<li>convert it into multiple Standard Job notifications (<code>NewMiningJob</code>), where each downstream Standard Channel’s <code>extranonce_prefix</code> is combined with <code>coinbase_tx_prefix</code> + <code>coinbase_tx_suffix</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For conversion into Standard Jobs, the Coinbase Transaction is constructed by concatenating these fields in this specific order: <code>coinbase_tx_prefix + extranonce_prefix + coinbase_tx_suffix</code>.</p>\n<p>The Coinbase Transaction is then combined with the <code>merkle_path</code> of the Extended Job to calculate the <code>merkle_root</code> for the Standard Job notification (<code>NewMiningJob</code>). Since Standard Jobs are HOM, there’s no <code>extranonce_size</code> field on the Standard Job notification.</p>\n<h3>5.1.3 Future Job</h3>\n<p>A Job with an empty template or speculated non-empty template can be sent in advance to speedup Job distribution when a new block is found on the network.</p>\n<p>The mining server MAY have precomputed such a Job and is able to pre-distribute it for all active Channels.\nThe only missing information to start to mine on the new block is the new <code>prev_hash</code>.\nThis information can be provided independently.</p>\n<p>Such an approach improves the efficiency of the protocol where the upstream node does not waste precious time immediately after a new block is found in the network.</p>\n<p>The trade-off here is that a non-empty Future Job could potentially contain a transaction that was already included in the block that was just propagated on the network, which would lead to an invalid block if successfully mined.</p>\n<p>So mining servers that provide non-empty Future Jobs SHOULD:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>never send a <code>SetNewPrevHash</code> for a Future Job that was later found to contain a conflicting transaction.</li>\n<li>minimize the probability of Future Jobs containing conflicting transactions (which leads to Future Jobs carrying less profitable templates).</li>\n<li>after a <code>SetNewPrevHash</code> is propagated for a Future Job, provide a non-Future Job for this same <code>prev_hash</code> as fast as possible (with a more profitable template).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>5.1.4 Custom Job</h3>\n<p>A Custom Job contains a set of transactions that were chosen by the miner instead of being unilaterally imposed by the Pool.</p>\n<p>Under the Job Declaration Protocol, upon request the Job Declarator Server (JDS) sends a <code>mining_job_token</code> to the Job Declarator Client.</p>\n<p>This <code>mining_job_token</code> is used by JDC for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>declaring a Custom Job to JDS (via <code>DeclareMiningJob</code> message of Job Declaration Protocol)</li>\n<li>notifying Pool about a Custom Job (via <code>SetCustomMiningJob</code> message of Mining Protocol)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a key feature of Stratum V2 that improves Bitcoin decentralization. Please see Job Declaration Protocol for more details.</p>\n<h2>5.2 Channel</h2>\n<p>The Mining Protocol is designed such that downstream Mining Devices open Channels with upstream Stratum Nodes within established Connections.\nThese upstream Stratum Nodes could be actual Work-Providing Nodes (e.g.: Pool, or Job Declarator Client) or simply Proxies that relay messages forward.</p>\n<p>Each Channel identifies a dedicated mining session associated with an authorized user.\nUpstream stratum nodes accept work submissions and specify a mining target on a per-channel basis.</p>\n<p>There can theoretically be up to <code>2^32</code> open Channels within one Connection. This is however just a theoretical ceiling, and it does not mean that every Connection will be able to fill this full capacity (maybe the search space has already been narrowed).</p>\n<p>All Channels are independent of each other, but share some messages broadcast from the server for higher efficiency (e.g. information about a new <code>prev_hash</code>).\nEach Channel is identified by its <code>channel_id</code> (<code>U32</code>), which is consistent throughout the whole life of the Connection. There MUST NOT be two Channels with the same ID in the same Connection.</p>\n<p>A Proxy can either transparently allow its clients to open separate Channels with the server (preferred behavior), or aggregate open connections from downstream devices into its own open channel with the server and translate the messages accordingly (present mainly for allowing v1 proxies).\nBoth options have some practical use cases.\nIn either case, proxies SHOULD aggregate clients’ Channels into a smaller number of Connections.\nThis saves network traffic for broadcast messages sent by a server because fewer messages need to be sent in total, which leads to lower latencies as a result.\nAnd it further increases efficiency by allowing larger packets to be sent.</p>\n<p>The protocol defines three types of Channels: <strong>Standard Channel</strong>, <strong>Extended Channel</strong> and <strong>Group Channel</strong>, which are useful for different purposes.</p>\n<h3>5.2.1 Standard Channel</h3>\n<p>Standard Channels are created by end Mining Devices.</p>\n<p>When an end Mining Device opens a Standard Channel with an upstream, it is restricted to Standard Jobs (via <code>REQUIRES_STANDARD_JOBS</code> bit flag of <code>SetupConnection</code> message).</p>\n<p>However, a Proxy could also transparently relay the Standard Channels from the downstream Mining Devices into new upstream Connections. In this case, the <code>REQUIRES_STANDARD_JOBS</code> bit flag will not be set for the <code>SetupConnection</code> message. This indicates that on this Connection, the Standard Channels can be assembled into a Group Channel and receive Extended Jobs for efficient distribution downstream.</p>\n<p>Then, the Connections between the Proxy and Mining Devices will receive Standard Jobs that were efficiently distributed from the Extended Jobs. The Merkle Root of each Standard Job is calculated by the Proxy, taking in consideration the <code>extranonce_prefix</code> that was assigned to each Standard Channel, plus the <code>coinbase_tx_prefix</code> and the <code>coinbase_tx_suffix</code> that were sent on the Extended Job. No <code>extranonce</code> field is used in this scenario.</p>\n<h3>5.2.2 Extended Channel</h3>\n<p>Extended Channels are intended to be used by Proxies for a more efficient distribution of hashing space.</p>\n<p>An Extended Channel carries the following properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>extranonce_prefix</code>: the Extended Extranonce bytes that were already allocated by the upstream server.</li>\n<li><code>extranonce_size</code>: how many bytes are available for the locally reserved and downstream reserved areas of the Extended Extranonce.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Upstream servers which accept connections and provide work MUST support Extended Channels.\nClients, on the other hand, do not have to support Extended Channels, as they MAY be implemented more simply with only Standard Channels at the end-device level.\nThus, upstream servers providing work MUST also support Standard Channels.</p>\n<p>The size of search space for an Extended Channel is <code>2^(nonce_bits + version_rolling_bits + extranonce_size*8)</code> per <code>nTime</code> value.</p>\n<h3>5.2.3 Group Channel</h3>\n<p>Standard channels opened within one particular connection can be grouped together to be addressable by a common communication group channel.</p>\n<p>Whenever a Standard Channel is created, it is always put into some Group Channel identified by its <code>group_channel_id</code>.\nGroup Channel ID namespace is the same as Standard Channel ID namespace on a particular connection.</p>\n<h2>5.3 Mining Protocol Messages</h2>\n<h3>5.3.1 <code>SetupConnection</code> Flags for Mining Protocol</h3>\n<p>Flags usable in <code>SetupConnection.flags</code> and <code>SetupConnection.Error::flags</code>, where bit 0 is the least significant bit of the u32 type:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Flag Name</th>\n<th>Bit</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>REQUIRES_STANDARD_JOBS</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>The downstream node requires standard jobs.

    "slug": "06-Job-Declaration-Protocol",
    "content": "# 6. Job Declaration Protocol\n\nThe Job Declaration Protocol is used to coordinate the creation of custom work, avoiding scenarios where Pools are unilaterally imposing work on miners.\n\nPools that opt into this protocol are only responsible for accounting shares and distributing rewards.\n\nThis is a key feature of Stratum V2 that improves Bitcoin decentralization.\n\n## 6.1 Job Declarator Server\n\nThe Job Declarator Server (JDS) is deployed on Pool side, although it could be theoretically outsourced to a third party that is trusted by the Pool.\n\nIn order to fully implement the Server side of the Job Declaration Protocol, the JDS also needs to exchange RPCs (or similar) with a Bitcoin Node. \n\nIt is responsible for:\n- Allocating tokens that JDC will use to declare Custom Jobs.\n- Acknowledging declaration of Custom Jobs associated with specific allocated tokens.\n- Maintaining an internal mempool (via RPCs (or similar) to a Bitcoin Node).\n- Requesting missing transactions on some declared Custom Job (only under Full-Template mode).\n- Publishing valid block submissions received from JDC.\n\n## 6.2 Job Declarator Client\n\nThe Job Declarator Client (JDC) is deployed on the miner side.\n\nIn order to fully implement the Client side of the Job Declaration Protocol, the JDC also needs to operate under the Template Distribution and Mining Protocols.\n\nIt is responsible for:\n- Receiving Templates from the Template Provider (via Template Distribution Protocol).\n- Declaring Custom Jobs to JDS (via Job Declaration Protocol under Full-Template mode).\n- Notifying declared Custom Jobs to Pool (via Mining Protocol).\n- Receiving Shares from downstream Mining Devices working on Custom Jobs (via Mining Protocol).\n- Submitting Shares for Custom Jobs to Pool.\n- Publishing valid blocks found by downstream Mining Devices (both to Template Provider (TP) and JDS).\n\nAdditionally, if:\n- JDS fails to respond with an `AllocateMiningJobToken.Success` in a reasonable time.\n- JDS rejects some Custom Job declaration via `DeclareMiningJob.Error`.\n- Pool rejects valid shares under a Custom Job that was previously acknowledged via `SetCustomMiningJob.Success` and/or `DeclareMiningJob.Success`.\n\nJDC is also responsible for switching to a new Pool+JDS (or solo mining as a last resort).\n\nThis fallback strategy incentivizes honesty on Pool side, otherwise it will lose hashrate by rejecting Shares for a Custom Job that was already acknowledged to be valid. It also allows the miner to never stop mining on their preferred templates.\n\n## 6.3 Job Declaration Modes\n\n### 6.3.1 Coinbase-only Mode\n\nUnder Coinbase-only mode:\n- JDS allocates `mining_job_token` to JDC (`AllocateMiningJobToken` / `AllocateMiningJobToken.Success`).\n- Pool evaluates fee revenue of some proposed work (uniquely identified by `mining_job_token`) by looking at the coinbase.\n- JDC never reveals the tx data contained in the template (in other words, the transaction set).\n- proposed work is acknowledged as valid by Pool via `SetCustomMiningJob.Success`.\n- the `DeclareMiningJob` message is never used.\n- if a valid block is found, JDC propagates it unilaterally.\n\nIn other words, Pool + JDS operating under Coinbase-only mode do not require to ever know which transactions are included in the miner template, preserving the privacy around the miner's mempool.\n\nThis leaves Pool arguably vulnerable to an attack where miner declares a coinbase with some fee revenue while one of the following situations is true:\n- the template actually has a different fee revenue.\n- the template has invalid transactions.\n\nThis potential attack vector is in many ways identical to block withholding and defenses against block withholding generally apply.\n\nSome pools may wish to utilize additional mitigations. For example, Zero-Knowledge-Proof based protocol extensions, where JDC proves that the fee revenue on the coinbase belongs to a valid template, without ever revealing the template itself.\n\n![](./img/jd_coinbase_mode.png)\n\nAs soon as JDC has:\n- a token (allocated by JDS), so it can use it to identify some unique work that it wants to advertise\n- a new template\n\nIt SHOULD start sending the jobs downstream for hashing right away.

The proof-of-work (shares) SHOULD be cached until JDC receives an acknowledgement via `SetCustomMiningJob.Success`.\n\n### 6.3.3 Coinbase-only vs Full-Template\n\nThe table below shows a comparison between the two Sv2 Job Declation Modes:\n\n|                                     | Coinbase-only | Full-Template |\n|-------------------------------------|-|-|\n| knowledge of fee revenue            | • JDC <br> • Pool (while blind against tx data) | • JDC <br> • Pool (while blind against tx data) <br> • JDS (verifying against revealed tx data on behalf of Pool) |\n| knowledge of txdata on the template | • JDC | • JDC <br> • JDS (on behalf of Pool) |\n| ability to broadcast mined block    | • JDC | • JDC <br> • JDS (on behalf of Pool) |\n\n## 6.4 Job Declaration Protocol Messages\n\n### 6.4.1 `SetupConnection` Flags for Job Declaration Protocol\n\nFlags usable in `SetupConnection.flags` and `SetupConnection.Error::flags`:\n\n| Field Name                | Bit | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| ------------------------- | --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| DECLARE_TX_DATA | 0   | JDC agrees to reveal the template's txdata via `DeclareMiningJob` and `ProvideMissingTransactions`. |\n\nNo flags are yet defined for use in `SetupConnection.Success`.\n\n### 6.4.2 `AllocateMiningJobToken` (JDC -> JDS)\n\nA request to get an identifier for a future-submitted mining job.\nRate limited to a rather slow rate and only available on connections where this has been negotiated.

While this output is initally set with a 0 amount of sats, this convention designates this locking script as the **pool payout output**.\n- JDS MAY add more 0 value outputs in addition to the pool payout output.\n\nOnce JDC receives `AllocateMiningJobToken.Success`, the following rules apply to the subsequent `DeclareMiningJob.coinbase_tx_suffix` (if under Full-Template mode) and `SetCustomMiningJob.coinbase_tx_outputs` (under both Full-Template and Coinbase-only modes) message fields:\n- JDC MUST allocate sats into the pool payout output in order to qualify for pooled mining rewards. JDS and Pool SHOULD reject custom jobs that fail to do so.\n- JDC MAY add more 0 value outputs in addition to the ones established by JDS.\n- JDC MAY add more non-0 value outputs in addition to the ones established by JDS. In doing so, the template revenue is not fully allocated to the designated pool payout output, so Pool MAY pay proportionally smaller rewards for this job.\n- JDC MAY arbitrarily reorder the outputs to something different from the original ordering of `AllocateMiningJobToken.Success.coinbase_tx_outputs`.\n- Under Full-Template mode, the order of the outputs under `DeclareMiningJob.coinbase_tx_suffix` and `SetCustomMiningJob.coinbase_tx_outputs` MUST remain the same, even if they differ from the original `AllocateMiningJobToken.Success.coinbase_tx_outputs`.\n\nIn summary, the pool payout goes to one single output (standardized as the first output of `AllocateMiningJobToken.Success.coinbase_tx_outputs`), and JDC is free to add more outputs and shuffle them under any arbitrary ordering scheme.\n\nHere's a few examples for clarification:\n\n#### Example A\n\nExample A illustrates JDS and JDC adding arbitrary 0 valued outputs in addition to the pool payout output.\n\nOutputs in `AllocateMiningJobToken.Success.coinbase_tx_outputs`:\n| Script      | Amount (sats)    | Description                                                       |\n|-------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| P2WPKH      | 0                | pool payout output                                                |\n| OP_RETURN X | 0                | arbitrary unspendable output imposed by JDS                       |\n| OP_RETURN Y | 0                | arbitrary unspendable output imposed by JDS                       |\n\nOutputs in `DeclareMiningJob.coinbase_tx_suffix` and/or `SetCustomMiningJob.coinbase_tx_outputs`:\n| Script      | Amount (sats)    | Description                                                       |\n|-------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| OP_RETURN Z | 0                | arbitrary unspendable output added by JDC                         |\n| P2WPKH      | template_revenue | pool payout output                                                |\n| OP_RETURN X | 0                | arbitrary unspendable output imposed by JDS                       |\n| OP_RETURN Y | 0                | arbitrary unspendable output imposed by JDS                       |\n| OP_RETURN W | 0                | SegWit commitment added by Template Provider                      |\n\n\n#### Example B\n\nExample B illustrates JDC allocating part of the template revenue to some outputs that are not the pool payout.

    "slug": "07-Template-Distribution-Protocol",
    "content": "# 7. Template Distribution Protocol\n\nThe Template Distribution protocol is used to receive updates of the block template to use in mining the next block.\nIt effectively replaces [BIP 22](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0022.mediawiki) and [BIP 23](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0023.mediawiki) (`getblocktemplate`) and provides a much more efficient API which allows Bitcoin Core (or some other full node software) to push template updates at more appropriate times as well as provide a template which may be mined on quickly for the block-after-next.\nWhile not recommended, the template update protocol can be a remote server, and is thus authenticated and signed in the same way as all other protocols (using the same SetupConnection handshake).\n\nLike the Job Declaration and Job Distribution protocols, all Template Distribution messages have the `channel_msg` bit unset, and there is no concept of channels.\nAfter the initial common handshake, the client MUST immediately send a `CoinbaseOutputConstraints` message to indicate the space it requires for coinbase output addition, to which the server MUST immediately reply with the current best block template it has available to the client.\nThereafter, the server SHOULD push new block templates to the client whenever the total fee in the current block template increases materially, and MUST send updated block templates whenever it learns of a new block.\n\nTemplate Providers MUST attempt to broadcast blocks which are mined using work they provided, and thus MUST track the work which they provided to clients.\n\n## 7.1 `CoinbaseOutputConstraints` (Client -> Server)\n\nUltimately, the pool is responsible for adding coinbase transaction outputs for payouts and other uses, and thus the Template Provider will need to consider this additional block size, and sigops when selecting transactions for inclusion in a block (to not create an invalid, oversized block).\nThus, this message is used to indicate that some additional space and sigops in the block/coinbase transaction be reserved for the pool’s use (while always assuming the pool will use the entirety of available coinbase space and sigops).\n\nThe Job Declarator MUST discover the maximum serialized size of the additional outputs and sigops which will be added by the pool(s) it intends to use this work.\nIt then MUST communicate it to the Template Provider via this message.\nThe Template Provider MUST NOT provide `NewTemplate` messages which would represent consensus-invalid blocks once this additional size and sigops — along with a maximally-sized (100 byte) coinbase script field — is added.\nFurther, the Template Provider MUST consider the maximum additional bytes required in the output count variable-length integer in the coinbase transaction when complying with the size limits.\nCurrent sigops limit per block in bitcoin is 80_000. We are not aware of any use cases where\ncoinbase have more the 65_535 so coinbase_output_max_sigops is an U16. Note that taproot outputs consume 0 sigops.\n\n| Field Name                            | Data Type | Description                                                                                     |\n| ------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| coinbase_output_max_additional_size   | U32       | The maximum additional serialized bytes which the pool will add in coinbase transaction outputs |\n| coinbase_output_max_additional_sigops | U16       | The maximum additional sigops which the pool will add in coinbase transaction outputs           |\n\n## 7.2 `NewTemplate` (Server -> Client)\n\nThe primary template-providing function.

This field must simply carry the ordered sequence of consensus‑serialized outputs, but the number of outputs MUST be inferred from `NewTemplate.coinbase_tx_outputs_count`. This is the equivalent of taking a CompactSize-prefixed array and dropping its (outer) prefix. \n\nPlease also note that in case the block contains SegWit transactions (and optionally blocks that don't as well), `NewTemplate.coinbase_tx_outputs` MUST carry the witness commitment. The `witness reserved value` (Coinbase witness) used for calculating this witness commitment is assumed to be 32 bytes of `0x00`, as it currently holds no consensus-critical meaning.

Discussion\n## 10.1 Speculative Mining Jobs\nTBD Describe how exactly sending of new jobs before the next block is found works. \n\n## 10.2 Rolling `nTime`\n- `nTime `field can be rolled once per second with the following notes:\n- Mining proxy must not interpret greater than minimum `nTime` as invalid submission.\n- Device MAY roll `nTime` once per second.\n- Pool SHOULD accept `nTime` which is within the consensus limits.\n- Pool MUST accept `nTime` rolled once per second.\n\n### 10.2.1 Hardware `nTime` rolling\nThe protocol allows `nTime` rolling in the hardware as long as the hardware can roll the `nTime` field once per second.\n\nModern bitcoin ASIC miners do/will support `nTime` rolling in hardware because it is the most efficient way to expand hashing space for one hashing core/chip.\nThe `nTime` field is part of the second SHA256 block so it shares midstates with the nonce.\nRolling `nTime` therefore can be implemented as efficiently as rolling nonce, with lowered communication with a mining chip over its communication channels.\nThe protocol needs to allow and support this.\n\n## 10.3 Notes\n- Legacy mode: update extranonce1, don’t send all the time (send common merkle-root)\n- mining on a locally obtained prevhash (server SHOULD queue the work for some time if the miner has faster access to the network).\n- Proxying with separated channels helps with merging messages into TCP stream, makes reconnecting more efficient (and done in proxy, not HW), allows to negotiate work for all devices at once.\n- Evaluate reaching the design goals.\n- Add promise protocol extension support. It is mainly for XMR and ZEC, but can be addressed in generic way already.\n  Promise construction can be coin specific, but the general idea holds for all known use cases.\n\n## 10.4 Usage Scenarios\nv2 ST - protocol v2 (this), standard channel\n\nv2 EX - protocol v2, extended channel\n\nv1 - original stratum v1 protocol\n\n### 10.4.1 End Device (v2 ST)\nTypical scenario for end mining devices, header-only mining.\nThe device:\n\n- Sets up the connection without enabling extended channels.\n- Opens a Standard channel or more (in the future).\n- Receives standard jobs with Merkle root provided by the upstream node.\n- Submits standard shares.\n\n### 10.4.2 Transparent Proxy (v2 any -> v2 any)\nTranslation from v2 clients to v2 upstream, without aggregating difficulty.\n\nTransparent proxy (connection aggregation):\n\n- Passes all `OpenChannel` messages from downstream connections to the upstream, with updated `request_id` for unique identification.\n- Associates `channel_id` given by `OpenChannel.Success` with the initiating downstream connection.\n  All further messages addressed to the `channel_id` from the upstream node are passed only to this connection, with `channel_id` staying stable.\n\n### 10.4.3 Difficulty Aggregating Proxy (v2 any -> v2 EX)\nProxy:\n- Translates all standard ...\n\nV1 \n\n(todo difficulty aggregation with info about the devices)\n\n\n### 10.4.4 Proxy (v1 -> v2)\nTranslation from v1 clients to v2 upstream. \n\nThe proxy:\n- Accept Opens ...\n\n\n### 10.4.5 Proxy (v2 -> v1)\n...\n\n\n## 10.5 FAQ\n\n\n### 10.5.1 Why is the protocol binary?\nThe original stratum protocol uses json, which has very bad ratio between the payload size and the actual information transmitted.\nDesigning a binary based protocol yields better data efficiency.\nTechnically, we can use the saved bandwidth for more frequent submits to further reduce the variance in measured hash rate and/or to allow individual machines to submit its work directly instead of using work-splitting mining proxy.\n\n## 10.6 Terminology\n- **upstream stratum node**: responsible for providing new mining jobs, information about new prevhash, etc. \n- **downstream stratum node**: consumes mining jobs by physically performing proof-of-work computations or by passing jobs onto further downstream devices.\n- **channel ID**: identifies an individual mining device or proxy after the channel has been opened. Upstream endpoints perform job submission \n- **public key**: ...\n- **signature**: signature encoded as...(?)\n- **BIP320**: this proposal identifies general purpose bits within version field of bitcoin block header. Mining devices use these bits to extend their search space.\n- **Merkle root**: the root hash of a Merkle tree which contains the coinbase transaction and the transaction set consisting of all the other transactions in the block.\n\n## 10.7 Open Questions / Issues\n- Write more about channel ID being identifier valid for a particular connection only.\n  It works only in the namespace of it.\n- Refresh sequence diagrams.\n- Is it useful to have channel-based reconnect?\n  Or is connection-based enough?\n- Decide on how to control a single device and allow it to have open multiple channels. \n- Describe precisely scenarios with `SetNewPrevHash` with regards to repeated block height\n- Decide on how to manage assignment of message ID's and the size of the message ID space.\n  Shall we allow 2 level multiplexing?\n  E.g. dedicate an ID to a class of vendor messages, while allowing the vendor to assign custom messages ID’s within the class?\n- More information about telemetry data\n\n```\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|                                                 Hashing Power Information                                            |\n+-------------------------+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Field Name              | Data Type        | Description                                                             |\n+-------------------------+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| aggregated_device_count | U32              | Number of aggregated devices on the channel.

Abstract\n\nThis document defines a Stratum V2 extension to negotiate support for other protocol extensions between clients and servers.\n\nThe mechanism allows clients to request support for a list of extensions immediately after the `SetupConnection` message exchange. The server responds with either:\n- `RequestExtensions.Success`, listing the supported extensions.\n- `RequestExtensions.Error`, listing the unsupported extensions and extensions required by the receiver.\n\nThis negotiation ensures that both parties can establish a common set of features before exchanging further protocol messages.\n\nTerms like \"MUST,\" \"MUST NOT,\" \"REQUIRED,\" etc., follow RFC2119 standards.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Overview\n\n### 1.1 Negotiating Extensions\n\nAfter the successful SetupConnection exchange, clients MUST send a `RequestExtensions` message to indicate the extensions they wish to use. The server responds with:\n- `RequestExtensions.Success`, confirming which extensions are supported.\n- `RequestExtensions.Error`, identifying unsupported extensions and required extensions from the responder.\n\nClients MUST NOT use any features from extensions that are not confirmed as supported by the server.\n\n#### Message Exchange Example\n\n- **Connection Setup**:\n    ```\n    Client --- SetupConnection (connection details) ---> Server\n    Client <--- SetupConnection.Success (connection accepted) ---- Server\n    ```\n\n- **Extension Negotiation**:\n    ```\n    Client --- RequestExtensions (list of requested U16) ---> Server\n   \n    Server Response:\n    If successful:\n    Client <--- RequestExtensions.Success (list of supported U16) ---- Server\n\n    If an error occurs:\n    Client <--- RequestExtensions.Error (unsupported U16, requested U16) ---- Server\n    ```\n  \n---\n\n## 2.

Implementation Notes\n\n1. **Error Handling**:\n    - Servers MUST respond with `RequestExtensions.Error` if none of the requested extensions are supported.\n    - If the server **requires** certain extensions but they were not included in the request, it MUST list them in the `requested_extensions` field of `RequestExtensions.Error`.\n\n2. **Ordering**:\n    - The `RequestExtensions` message MUST be sent immediately after `SetupConnection.Success` and before any other protocol-specific messages.\n    - The response to `RequestExtensions` MUST be received before proceeding with any further protocol-specific messages.\n\n#### 3. **Backward Compatibility**:\n- **Server Behavior**:\n   - Servers that do not support this extension will ignore the `RequestExtensions` message.\n\n- **Client Behavior**:\n   - Clients MUST NOT send any further extension-specific messages until they receive a `RequestExtensions.Success` or `RequestExtensions.Error` response.\n   - Clients MAY implement the following timeout and reconnection strategy:\n     1. After sending `RequestExtensions`, wait for a timeout of 2x the initial connection time\n     2. If no response is received within this timeout:\n        - Reconnect to the same server\n        - Attempt the extension negotiation again\n     3. If still no response after 5x the initial connection time:\n        - Reconnect one final time\n        - Proceed without any extensions\n     4. If the total connection time exceeds approximately 1 second:\n        - Consider switching to a fallback pool\n   - This strategy ensures that:\n     - The first reconnection serves as a basic connectivity check\n     - The total connection time remains reasonable for mining operations\n     - Clients can gracefully fallback to non-extension operation\n     - Users can switch to alternative pools if connection times are too high\n\nThis ensures clients can handle servers that do not implement extensions negotiation gracefully while maintaining reasonable connection times for mining operations.\n\n4. **Example Use Case**:\n   A client requesting support for extensions `0x0002` and `0x0003`:\n   ```\n   Client --- RequestExtensions [0x0002, 0x0003] ---> Server  \n   Client <--- RequestExtensions.Success [0x0002] ---- Server\n   ```\n   The client now knows that extension `0x0003` is not supported and must adapt its behavior accordingly.\n\n5. **Example Use Case with Unsupported Extension**:\n   A client requesting only extension `0x0002`, but the server doesn't support it:\n   ```\n   Client --- RequestExtensions [0x0002] ---> Server  \n   Client <--- RequestExtensions.Error [unsupported: 0x0002, required: []] ---- Server\n   ```\n   The client now knows that extension `0x0002` is not supported, but since no extensions are required by the server, the client MAY continue without using any extensions.\n\n6. **Example Use Case with Server Requesting Extensions**:\n   A server requiring extension `0x0005`, but the client did not include it in its request:\n   ```\n   Client --- RequestExtensions [0x0002, 0x0003] ---> Server  \n   Client <--- RequestExtensions.Error [unsupported: 0x0003, required: 0x0005] ---- Server\n   ```\n   The client now knows that the server requires extension `0x0005` and MAY choose to retry with a modified request. If the client does not retry with the required extension, the server MUST disconnect the client.",

    "content": "# Stratum V2 Extension: Worker-Specific Hashrate Tracking\n\n## 0. Abstract\n\nThis document proposes a Stratum V2 extension to enable mining pools to track individual workers (`user_identity`) within extended channels. By extending the `SubmitSharesExtended` message via `Type-Length-Value (TLV)` encoding, pools can track worker-specific hashrate while preserving the existing channel structure.\n\nTerms like \"MUST,\" \"MUST NOT,\" \"REQUIRED,\" etc., follow RFC2119 standards.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Extension Overview\n\nThis extension modifies the existing `SubmitSharesExtended` message by introducing a **new TLV field** that contains the `user_identity` (worker name). The extension follows the [Stratum V2 TLV encoding model](../03-Protocol-Overview.md#341-stratum-v2-tlv-encoding-model), where each extension is assigned a `Type (U16)` identifier negotiated between the client and server.\n\n### 1.1 TLV Format for `user_identity`\nWhen this extension is enabled, the client MUST append the following TLV field to `SubmitSharesExtended`:\n\n| Field            | Size      | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Type (U16 \\| U8) | 3 bytes   | Unique identifier for the TLV field, structured as: <br> - **Extension Type (U16)**: `0x0002` (Worker-Specific Hashrate Tracking) <br> - **Field Type (U8)**: `0x01` (`user_identity`) |\n| Length (U16)     | 2 bytes   | Length of the value (max **32 bytes**)                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Value            | `N` bytes | UTF-8 encoded `user_identity` (worker name)                                                                                                                                            |\n\nIf `user_identity` is shorter than **32 bytes**, it MUST NOT be padded. The `Length` field MUST indicate the actual byte size.\n\n---\n\n### **Example TLV Encoding**\n\n```\n[TYPE: 0x0002|0x01] [LENGTH: 0x000A] [VALUE: \"Worker_001\"]\n```\n(Where `\"Worker_001\"` is 10 bytes long)\n\n**Breaking it down:**\n- `0x0002|0x01` → **Type (U16 | U8)**\n    - `0x0002` (**U16 - Extension Type**) → Worker-Specific Hashrate Tracking\n    - `0x01` (**U8 - Field Type**) → `user_identity`\n- `0x000A` → **Length** (10 bytes)\n- `\"Worker_001\"` → **Value** (UTF-8 encoded string)\n\n### 1.2 Extension Activation (Negotiation Process)\n\nTo enable this extension, the initiator MUST send a `RequestExtensions` message immediately after the `SetupConnection` message, requesting extension `0x0002`. If the receiver supports it, it responds with a `RequestExtensions.Success` message.\n\n#### Message Exchange Example\n\n1. **Connection Setup**:\n    ```\n    Client --- SetupConnection (connection details) ---> Server\n    Client <--- SetupConnection.Success (connection accepted) ---- Server\n    ```\n\n2. **Extension Request**:\n    ```\n    Client --- RequestExtensions [0x0002] ---> Server\n    ```\n\n3. **Server Response**:\n   - If successful:\n     ```\n     Client <--- RequestExtensions.Success [0x0002] ---- Server\n     ```\n   - If an error occurs:\n     ```\n     Client <--- RequestExtensions.Error [0x0002] ---- Server\n     ```\n\nOnce negotiated, the client MUST append the TLV containing `user_identity` to every `SubmitSharesExtended` message.\n\n### 1.3 Behavior Based on Negotiation\n\n- **If the extension is negotiated**:\n    - The `user_identity` field **MUST** be included in `SubmitSharesExtended` as a TLV with Type `0x0002`.\n- **If the extension is not negotiated**:\n    - The `user_identity` field **MUST** not be included.\n    - The server **MUST** ignore any unexpected TLV fields.\n\nSince all extensions are negotiated before use, **the order of TLV fields is not relevant**.

    "html": "<h1>Stratum V2 Extension: Worker-Specific Hashrate Tracking</h1>\n<h2>0. Abstract</h2>\n<p>This document proposes a Stratum V2 extension to enable mining pools to track individual workers (<code>user_identity</code>) within extended channels. By extending the <code>SubmitSharesExtended</code> message via <code>Type-Length-Value (TLV)</code> encoding, pools can track worker-specific hashrate while preserving the existing channel structure.</p>\n<p>Terms like “MUST,” “MUST NOT,” “REQUIRED,” etc., follow RFC2119 standards.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>1. Extension Overview</h2>\n<p>This extension modifies the existing <code>SubmitSharesExtended</code> message by introducing a <strong>new TLV field</strong> that contains the <code>user_identity</code> (worker name). The extension follows the <a href=\"../03-Protocol-Overview.md#341-stratum-v2-tlv-encoding-model\">Stratum V2 TLV encoding model</a>, where each extension is assigned a <code>Type (U16)</code> identifier negotiated between the client and server.</p>\n<h3>1.1 TLV Format for <code>user_identity</code></h3>\n<p>When this extension is enabled, the client MUST append the following TLV field to <code>SubmitSharesExtended</code>:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Size</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Type (U16 | U8)</td>\n<td>3 bytes</td>\n<td>Unique identifier for the TLV field, structured as: <br> - <strong>Extension Type (U16)</strong>: <code>0x0002</code> (Worker-Specific Hashrate Tracking) <br> - <strong>Field Type (U8)</strong>: <code>0x01</code> (<code>user_identity</code>)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Length (U16)</td>\n<td>2 bytes</td>\n<td>Length of the value (max <strong>32 bytes</strong>)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Value</td>\n<td><code>N</code> bytes</td>\n<td>UTF-8 encoded <code>user_identity</code> (worker name)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If <code>user_identity</code> is shorter than <strong>32 bytes</strong>, it MUST NOT be padded. The <code>Length</code> field MUST indicate the actual byte size.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3><strong>Example TLV Encoding</strong></h3>\n<pre><code>[TYPE: 0x0002|0x01] [LENGTH: 0x000A] [VALUE: &quot;Worker_001&quot;]\n</code></pre>\n<p>(Where <code>&quot;Worker_001&quot;</code> is 10 bytes long)</p>\n<p><strong>Breaking it down:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>0x0002|0x01</code> → <strong>Type (U16 | U8)</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><code>0x0002</code> (<strong>U16 - Extension Type</strong>) → Worker-Specific Hashrate Tracking</li>\n<li><code>0x01</code> (<strong>U8 - Field Type</strong>) → <code>user_identity</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>0x000A</code> → <strong>Length</strong> (10 bytes)</li>\n<li><code>&quot;Worker_001&quot;</code> → <strong>Value</strong> (UTF-8 encoded string)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>1.2 Extension Activation (Negotiation Process)</h3>\n<p>To enable this extension, the initiator MUST send a <code>RequestExtensions</code> message immediately after the <code>SetupConnection</code> message, requesting extension <code>0x0002</code>. If the receiver supports it, it responds with a <code>RequestExtensions.Success</code> message.</p>\n<h4>Message Exchange Example</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Connection Setup</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code>Client --- SetupConnection (connection details) ---&gt; Server\nClient &lt;--- SetupConnection.Success (connection accepted) ---- Server\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Extension Request</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code>Client --- RequestExtensions [0x0002] ---&gt; Server\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Server Response</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If successful:<pre><code>Client &lt;--- RequestExtensions.Success [0x0002] ---- Server\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>If an error occurs:<pre><code>Client &lt;--- RequestExtensions.Error [0x0002] ---- Server\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once negotiated, the client MUST append the TLV containing <code>user_identity</code> to every <code>SubmitSharesExtended</code> message.</p>\n<h3>1.3 Behavior Based on Negotiation</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>If the extension is negotiated</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>user_identity</code> field <strong>MUST</strong> be included in <code>SubmitSharesExtended</code> as a TLV with Type <code>0x0002</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>If the extension is not negotiated</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>user_identity</code> field <strong>MUST</strong> not be included.</li>\n<li>The server <strong>MUST</strong> ignore any unexpected TLV fields.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since all extensions are negotiated before use, <strong>the order of TLV fields is not relevant</strong>. The receiver <strong>MUST</strong> scan for TLV fields corresponding to known negotiated extensions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>2.
